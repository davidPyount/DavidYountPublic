# DavidYountPublic
 Collection of Public Code written by David Yount for demonstration and educational purposes.

Code on this repository is written primarily by me but may make use of 3rd party inspiration or libraries. Where those are in use, comments at the top of code will give the link to other repositories where inspiration or guidance in taken from. Most of my work with the BeagelBone Black is guided by Derek Molloy's textbook: Exploring BeagleBone: Tools and Techniques for Building with Embedded Linux ISBN-10 1118935128 and various Adafruit libraries. Code posted here is intended to run on embedded linux (Debian) micro-computers or arduino systems, and will likely not compile on your host computer.

Code here is uploaded primarily to display competency with embedded systems and C/C++ to interested parties and to help educate my collegues and team members. There are many points in code uploaded to this repo where demonstrating a concept takes priority over efficiency. I will comment on those cases.

This repository is a work in progress. It is intended to host primarily presonal projects that are executed by me. Work with my project org, Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, falls under an NDA and ITAR regulations and cannot be disclosed publicly.
