Current projects in the works:

Guitar Auto-Tuner Prototype 1 (Note Detection):
    *Parts ordered and mic-op amp- DC offeset- ADC circuit assembled. Needs testing on Arduino UNO. 
    *Eventual plans to port to BBB.

Plant pot soil humidity detector:
    *Just need to order the detector and an Arduino nano or Adafruit feather. Detector uses I2C.
    *Would take 20min to get working
    *Need to decide where to send the data. Could integrate into an IOT hub and post it to an apache web server on a BBB. 
    *Opens up room for more IOT projects.

Autonomous Steering of Electric Skateboard
    *Need to interface with Vedder Electronic Speed Controller using https://github.com/SolidGeek/VescUart.git
    *Make sure each motor can be throttled independantly using SolidGeek's library.
